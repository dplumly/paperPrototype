paperPrototype
==============

Both Matt and I went undergrad and grad school together for Creative Technology. We both have a love for great tools with great design and have both used paper as a prototyping tool.
Matt stumbled across a prototyping tool called the Ironphone. It was a great step in making paper prototyping more realistic for the user. The only problem was the people that made it didn't make it open source. With that in mind we decided to make our own and take it to the next level.

In the PAPERPROTO.zip file you will find a .stl and a .pdf that work together hand in hand. Cut the paper out to fit in the phone and start paper prototying!

Feel free to make any changes to suit your needs. The phone is also up on shapeways in case you don't have access to a 3D printer.
